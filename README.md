# House-Prices-Prediction
This is a basic machine learning project done for our lab work.. In this project, I tried to predict the prices of houses. The model I used are Linear Regression and Random Forest Algorithm
The dataset was downloaded from kaggle. dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset
From the statistics, it was noticeable that the price was determined all other existing factors.
Label Encoding was used for converting string values to numeric values
Linear Regression model gives better performance than Random Forest Algorithm
